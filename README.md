We are conducting a comprehensive analysis and exploration of the decision-making process faced by individuals after college, particularly the choice between pursuing a graduate degree or entering the workforce. This is a topic that has been full of hot debate among peers, and behind making the choice are a lot of different factors to take into account, finances, personal preference, value for money, time, and other considerations, as we hope to help a lot of younger people who have a harder time deciding between the two by focusing on data of employment rates at different levels of education and different ages. We hope it would be beneficial to undergraduate students and have a reference backed up by real statistics. In this storyline, we created Jamie's situation as the storyline character to understand the challenges and opportunities of each choice.

Our target group is undergraduate students, especially those who are about to make key decisions after completing their undergraduate education. This group is facing the dilemma of whether to continue their education or join the workforce, a decision that can have a significant impact on their future trajectory since social identity as a student or a worker is different. By analyzing and providing the data analysis for this topic, we would like to provide some insights that might be helpful for students to make more considerate decisions.

Because individuals are different, we can't say that our data will necessarily be useful to them, but hopefully, data from official sources will help them use it as a reference and gain some perspective from our work. It will not only help students understand the tendency of employers to choose candidates in today's job market but also show the real employment environment and competitiveness for the audience. Therefore, this report is not just a study of Jamie's situation, it also provides a broader tool for individuals facing critical choices.
